      <h1>What is CSUS?</h1>
      <p>
        This is the University of Calgary's Computer Science Undergraduate Societies (CSUS) website.
        Since at least the 1980's (we don't exactly know)  CSUS has been dedicated to improving the condition of Computer Science majors and along with the CPSC curious. We have an clubroom in Math Science 130 (MS130) which can be found by taking a hard right when you enter MS from the main doors. You will find the club's exec team and members hanging out in the room for most of the school day but there is never a guarantee that the room will be open.
      </p>

    <h1>What does CSUS do?</h1>

    <ul>
      <li>We are the connection between the Department of Computer Science and the undergrad population. This involves attending meetings with the department to plan operations or discussing undergrad issues. </li>

      <li>We provide a community for those interested in CPSC. Our clubroom MS130 provides a place for people to come chill during breaks between classes; nobody should be forced to eat lunch alone. </li>

      <li>We hold a variety of social events but a perennial favorite is board games and pizza.</li>

      <li>We hold academic events to teach important CPSC skills, for example tutorials on Git or BASH.</li> 

      <li>We organize Calgary Hacks on an annual basis. This event challenges groups of up to 8 people to develop and application in response to a prompt. We invite students from any faculty and any Canadian school to come compete and develop something rad.</li> 

    </ul>
    
    <h1>What does it mean to be a CSUS member?</h1>
    <p>
      Unlike other clubs CSUS is not about accomplishing specific task (ie. solar car club) but rather about providing a community for people with similar interests. Because of this membership in our club is a unstructured thing where we don't ask you specifically to sign up for some email list or pay an entry fee. Instead being a member of CSUS is about being active in the community whether that be on Discord or in 
      person.
